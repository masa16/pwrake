Parallel Workflow extension for Rake, runs on multicores, clusters, clouds.

([RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/pwrake))

## Features

* Pwrake executes a workflow written in Rakefile in parallel.
  * The specification of Rakefile is same as Rake.
  * The tasks which do not have mutual dependencies are automatically executed in parallel.
  * The `multitask` which is a parallel task definition of Rake is no more necessary.
* Parallel and distributed execution is possible using a computer cluster which consists of multiple compute nodes.
  * Cluster settings: SSH login, and the directory sharing using a shared filesystem, e.g., NFS, Gfarm.
  * Pwrake automatically connects to remote hosts using SSH. You do not need to start a daemon.
  * Remote host names and the number of cores to use are provided in a hostfile.
* [Gfarm file system](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gfarm/) utilizes storage of compute nodes. It provides the high-performance parallel I/O.
  * Parallel I/O access to local stroage of compute nodes enables scalable increase in the I/O performance.
  * Gfarm schedules a compute node to store an output file, to local storage.
  * Pwrake schedules a compute node to execute a task, to a node where input files are stored.
  * Other supports for Gfarm: Automatic mount of the Gfarm file system, etc.

## Installation

Download source tgz/zip and expand, cd to subdirectory and install:

    $ ruby setup.rb

Or, gem install:

    $ gem install pwrake

## Usage

### Parallel execution using 4 cores at localhost:

    $ pwrake -j 4

### Parallel execution using all cores at localhost:

    $ pwrake -j

### Parallel execution using total 2*2 cores at remote 2 hosts:

1. Share your directory among remote hosts via distributed file system such as NFS, Gfarm.
2. Allow passphrase-less access via SSH in either way:
   * Add passphrase-less key generated by `ssh-keygen`.  (Be careful)
   * Add passphrase using `ssh-add`.
3. Make `hosts` file in which remote host names and the number of cores are listed:

        $ cat hosts
        host1 2
        host2 2

4. Run `pwrake` with an option `--hostfile` or `-F`:

        $ pwrake --hostfile=hosts

### pwrake_conf.yaml

* If `pwrake_conf.yaml` exists at current directory, Pwrake reads options from it.
* Example (in YAML form):

        HOSTFILE: hosts
        LOG_DIR: true
        DISABLE_AFFINITY: true
        DISABLE_STEAL: true
        FAILED_TARGET: delete
        PASS_ENV :
         - ENV1
         - ENV2

* Option list:

        HOSTFILE, HOSTS   nil(default, localhost)|filename
        LOG_DIR, LOG      nil(default, No log output)|true(dirname="Pwrake%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")|dirname
        LOG_FILE          default="pwrake.log"
        TASK_CSV_FILE     default="task.csv"
        COMMAND_CSV_FILE  default="command.csv"
        GC_LOG_FILE       default="gc.log"
        WORK_DIR          default=$PWD
        FILESYSTEM        default(autodetect)|gfarm
        SSH_OPTION        SSH option
        SHELL_COMMAND     default=$SHELL
        SHELL_RC          Run-Command when shell starts
        PASS_ENV          (Array) Environment variables passed to SSH

* Options for Gfarm system:

        DISABLE_AFFINITY    default=false
        DISABLE_STEAL       default=false
        GFARM_BASEDIR       default="/tmp"

        GFARM2FS_DEBUG      default=false
        GFARM2FS_DEBUG_WAIT default=1

## Task Properties

* Task properties are specified in `desc` strings above task definition in Rakefile.

Example of Rakefile:

``` ruby
desc "ncore=4 allow=ourhost*" # desc has no effect on rule in original Rake, but it is used for task property in Pwrake.
rule ".o" => ".c" do
  sh "..."
end

(1..n).each do |i|
  desc "ncore=2 steal=no" # desc should be inside of loop because it is effective only for the next task.
  file "task#{i}" do
    sh "..."
  end
end
```

Properties (The leftmost item is default):

    ncore=integer     - The number of cores used by this task.
    exclusive=no|yes  - Exclusively execute this task in a single node.
    allow=hostname    - Allow this host to execute this task. (accepts wild card)
    deny=hostname     - Deny this host to execute this task. (accepts wild card)
    order=deny,allow|allow,deny - The order of evaluation.
    steal=yes|no      - Allow task stealing for this task.

## Note for Gfarm

* `gfwhere-pipe` script (included in Pwrake) is used for file-affinity scheduling.
  This script requires Ruby/FFI (https://github.com/ffi/ffi). Install FFI by

        gem install ffi

## For Graph Partitioning

* Compile and Install METIS 5.1.0 (http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis/). This requires CMake.

* Install RbMetis (https://github.com/masa16/rbmetis) by

        gem install rbmetis -- \
         --with-metis-include=/usr/local/include \
         --with-metis-lib=/usr/local/lib

## Current version

* Pwrake version 2.0.0

## Tested Platform

* Ruby 2.2.2
* Rake 10.4.2
* CentOS 6.7
